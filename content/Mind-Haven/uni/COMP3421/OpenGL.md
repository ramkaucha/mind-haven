Cross-platform graphics application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics
Typically used to interact with graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering

C++ and JavaScript is the language of choice for OpenGL


## Graphics card and openGL
OpenGL libraries are usually developed by the graphics card manufacturers

## OpenGL libraries
toolkits to create and manage OpenGL windows, and manage input:
`GLFW` - cross-platform game-oriented windowing and keyboard, mouse, joystick handler
`Freeglut` - cross-platform windowing and keyboard-mouse handler

multimedia libraries to create OpenGL windows, in addition to input, sound and other tasks useful for game-like applications:
`Allegro 5` - cross-platform multimedia library with a C API focused on game development
`Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)` - cross-platform multimedia library with a C API
`SFML` - cross-platform multimedia library with `C++` API and multiple other bindings to languages such as `C#, Java, Haskell` and  `Go`
