# Digital circuits
The study of digital logic circuits is motivated by their use in digital computers
Logic circuits perform operations on digital signals and are usually implemented as *electronic circuits* in which the signal values are restricted to a few discrete values (in binary logic, circuits, there are only two values, 0 and 1)

Analog circuits signals may take on continuous values between maximum and minimum levels
