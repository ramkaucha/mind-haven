Study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors.

geometric vector - entity characterised by both magnitude and direction, represented as an arrow in space (bold in this book), which can be used to model quantities like displacement, force or velocity.
polynomials - are also instances of vectors, as 2 polynomials can also perform vector operations. However, geometric vectors are concrete 'drawings' while polynomials are abstract concepts.
audio signals are vectors - represented as series of numbers, we can add audio signals together, and their sum would be a new audio signal, therefore it is also a type of vector.
elements of $R^n$ (tuples of 'n' real numbers) are vectors, $R^n$ is more abstract than polynomials.

Linear algebra focuses on the similarities between these vector concepts.
