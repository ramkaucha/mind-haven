Overview:
Machine learning is about designing algorithms that automatically extract valuable information from data.
Three core concepts of ml - data, model, and learning 
Goal of ml is to design general-purpose methodologies to extract valuable patterns from data, ideally without much domain-specific expertise.

predictors - ml algorithm -> a system that makes predictions based on input data
training a system - ml algorithm -> a system that adapts some internal parameters of the predictor so that it performs well on future unseen input data.

model: used to describe a process for generating data, similar to the dataset at hand. 

Training model means to use the data available to optimise some parameters of the model with respect to a utility function that evaluates how well the model predicts the training data.
